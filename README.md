Project: Network Packet Analyzer in Python

The Network Packet Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to capture, analyze, and interpret network traffic. It enables users to inspect data packets transmitted over a network, offering insights into network behavior, performance, and security. By leveraging Python libraries such as scapy, socket, and dpkt, the tool can capture packets, decode protocols, and provide detailed information about each packet, such as source/destination IP addresses, ports, protocol types (TCP, UDP, ICMP), payloads, and flags.

Key Features:

1. Packet Capture: Intercept network packets from a specified network interface in real-time.


2. Protocol Analysis: Decode and analyze common network protocols such as IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, HTTP, DNS, and more.


3. Packet Filtering: Apply filters based on IP addresses, ports, or specific protocols to focus on relevant traffic.


4. Traffic Visualization: Generate summaries or visual graphs (e.g., using matplotlib) for better understanding of network activity.


5. Packet Statistics: Provide statistics such as packet count, byte count, protocol distribution, and more.


6. Security Monitoring: Detect suspicious network behavior, such as abnormal traffic patterns or unauthorized access attempts.



Applications:

Network Troubleshooting: Identifying network bottlenecks, dropped packets, and performance issues.

Security Auditing: Monitoring network traffic for malicious activity, unauthorized access, or data breaches.

Learning and Education: Helping users understand network protocols, packet structures, and traffic flows in real-time.


Technologies Used:

Python Libraries: scapy for packet capture and manipulation, socket for low-level network interactions, dpkt for packet parsing, matplotlib for visualization.

Protocols: TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, ARP, DNS, HTTP, etc.


This project serves as both a practical tool for network administrators and security professionals and a learning resource for those interested in networking and cybersecurity.
